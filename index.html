  <h1>My Coding Journey</h1>
  <p>Friday, July 11th 2025.</p>
  <p>Today marks exactly TWO months since I began my coding journey.</p>
  <p>And honestly... if someone had told me I’d be building projects using Java, CSS, and even XML by now, I probably would’ve laughed in disbelief.</p>
  <p>Before this, I used to watch coding videos and tutorials — but everything felt like a foreign language. I was just copying code without understanding what it really did. It was frustrating, confusing, and often overwhelming.</p>
  <p>But I didn’t give up.</p>
  <p>I stayed consistent — through errors, roadblocks, and moments of doubt. Slowly, things started to click. The dots began to connect. I stopped just watching, and I started building.</p>
  
  <h2>Where I Started</h2>
  <p>My very first line of code was written in <strong>Python</strong>. Although I began with Python, I soon expanded my toolkit—learning to code on my Android phone using Termux and eventually managing my projects with GitHub.</p>
  
  <h2>What I’ve Achieved So Far</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ Built real projects</li>
    <li>✅ Collaborated with others</li>
    <li>✅ Faced and fixed countless bugs</li>
    <li>✅ Actually started enjoying the process of solving them</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>My Tech Stack</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Languages:</strong> Python, Java, CSS, XML</li>
    <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Termux (on Android), GitHub</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>My Mission</h2>
  <p>
    I hope to inspire other beginners and show that with consistency and curiosity, anyone can become a developer. If you feel like you’re “not getting it”—don’t give up. Sometimes, all it takes is the right guidance and the right space to grow.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Be patient. Stay curious. Keep going. Your breakthrough will come.</strong>
